## What is it?
Currently in development, Poly-Crafting-Idle is a game framework for creating low-poly games in UnityEngine with procedural
generation and physics simulation capabilities. It provides the utilities and systems for designing these low-poly
games with fully destructible environments. Systems will include crafting, machine construction, farming, wildlife,
idle, advancement, mining, combat, enemy and npc. The designed games should run on any platform including mobile.

## How to install:
You can install by cloning the repo to a local folder and importing it to UnityEngine or you can launch UnityEngine and 
import it directly from GitHub. 

## How to contribute:
If you want to contribute to this project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is a great way 
to learn more about social coding on GitHub, new technologies and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, 
helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request.

### How to make a clean pull request
- Create a personal fork of the project on GitHub.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on GitHub is called origin.
- Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from develop if it exists, else from master.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- If the project has tests run them!
- Write or adapt tests as needed.
- Add or change the documentation as needed.
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's interactive rebase. Create a new branch if necessary.
- Push your branch to your fork on GitHub, the remote origin.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's develop branch if there is one, else 
go for master!
- ...
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your 
extra branch(es).
- And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe 
what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
